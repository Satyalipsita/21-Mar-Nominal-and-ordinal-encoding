    "    Ordinal and label encoding are techniques used to transform categorical data into\n",
    "    numerical values that can be used as input for machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal encoding is a technique used to encode categorical features where the categories \n",
    "have an inherent order or hierarchy. For example, consider a feature called \"Education Level\" with \n",
    "categories such as \"High School\", \"College\", \"Masters\", and \"PhD\". These categories can be ordered \n",
    "from lowest to highest education level. In this case, ordinal encoding assigns numerical values to \n",
    "each category based on their order. For example, \"High School\" can be assigned 1, \"College\" can be \n",
    "assigned 2, \"Masters\" can be assigned 3, and \"PhD\" can be assigned 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoding is a technique used to encode categorical features where the categories do not have\n",
    "an inherent order or hierarchy. For example, consider a feature called \"City\" with categories such \n",
    "as \"New York\", \"Paris\", \"Tokyo\", and \"Sydney\". These categories do not have a natural ordering. \n",
    "In this case, label encoding assigns numerical values to each category by mapping each category \n",
    "to a unique integer value. For example, \"New York\" can be assigned 1, \"Paris\" can be assigned 2, \n",
    "\"Tokyo\" can be assigned 3, and \"Sydney\" can be assigned 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both ordinal and label encoding are useful when dealing with categorical data in\n",
    "machine learning models. However, it is important to be careful when using these techniques, \n",
    "as they can introduce bias or distortions in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal encoding should only be used when the categories have an inherent order or hierarchy. \n",
    "Label encoding should be used when the categories do not have an inherent order or hierarchy. \n",
    "If the number of categories is large, label encoding may not be the best approach as it can \n",
    "lead to a high-dimensional feature space, which can negatively impact model performance. \n",
    "In such cases, one may consider using one-hot encoding, which is a technique that creates \n",
    "binary features for each category."

    "    Target-guided ordinal encoding is a technique used to encode categorical \n",

    "    we order the categories based on the target variable's mean or median value and\n",

    "a customer will default on their loan or not, which is the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply target-guided ordinal encoding, we first calculate the mean or median\n",
    "value of the target variable for each category of the \"Education Level\" feature.\n",
    "We then order the categories based on their mean or median value, and assign numerical \n",
    "values to each category based on their order.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's assume that the mean default rate for each category is as follows:\n",

    "High School: 0.2\n",
    "College: 0.15\n",
    "Masters: 0.1\n",
    "PhD: 0.05\n",

    "High School\n",
    "College\n",
    "Masters\n",
    "PhD\n",

    "be assigned 3, and \"PhD\" would be assigned 4.\n",

    "This encoding technique can be useful in cases where the relationship between the \n",
